## **Project Overview**

This Discord Rich Presence is a bridge between the known social media [Discord](https://discord.com) and the commonly used music service [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/). Currently, Apple doesn't have [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence) built in by default into their Music and iTunes apps for MacOS and Windows by default, respectively, so this app was made to do just that. Other parties like Spotify have had full integration with Discord, so it's about time that something efficient is made for Apple Music.

### **Project Goals:**
* Efficient timing and re-calculation of song duration
* Update the status as efficiently as possible to prevent computer lag or fans turning on.

## **App Features**

### **1. Song Details**
  * Song name
  * song album
  * Song artist

### **2. Song Paused Screen**
  * Displays that the song is paused and a "paused" image appears.
  * Hides Album name (unfortunately)
